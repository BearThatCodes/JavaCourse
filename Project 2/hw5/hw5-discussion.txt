Doing the command execution inside the synchronize block for the commandQueue results in a much less efficient implementation. The reason for this is that, although we have many (or in this case 5) threads working to complete the tasks in the commandQueue, if we do our command execution inside the synchronize block only one can really be "working" at any given time. This means that we get only minimal benefit from having threads at all and would likely see similar performance from a single-threaded application (since the bulk of the work/time is done inside the synchronize block).

Moving the command execution outside the synchronize block results in a MUCH more efficient implementation. This is because, although each thread still needs to lock the commandQueue, the time-intensive part of the execution can be done in parallel with the other threads. In other words, each thread only needs to lock the commandQueue long enough to check if there is a command to execute and, if there is, pop that command from the queue. In contrast, when doing command execution inside the synchronize block, each thread needs to check if there is a command, pop the command, and then EXECUTE the command all before any other thread can do any meaningful work.
